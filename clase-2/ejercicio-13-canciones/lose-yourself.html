        <h2>Letra</h2>
        <p>Look</p>
        <p>If you had</p>
        <p>One shot</p>
        <p>Or one opportunity</p>
        <p>To seize everything you ever wanted</p>
        <p>In one moment</p>
        <p>Would you capture it</p>
        <p>Or just let it slip?</p>
        <p>Yo</p>
        <p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy</p>
        <p>There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</p>
        <p>He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready</p>
        <p>To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'</p>
        <p>What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud</p>
        <p>He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out</p>
        <p>He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now</p>
        <p>The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow</p>
        <p>Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity</p>
        <p>Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked</p>
        <p>He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No</p>
        <p>He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes</p>
        <p>It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke</p>
        <p>He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's</p>
        <p>Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody</p>
        <p>Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p>
        <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
        <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
        <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
        <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
        <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
        <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
        <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
        <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
        <p>You better</p>
        <p>His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping</p>
        <p>This world is mine for the taking</p>
        <p>Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order</p>
        <p>A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem</p>
        <p>It only grows harder, only grows hotter</p>
        <p>He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him</p>
        <p>Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter</p>
        <p>Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father</p>
        <p>He goes home and barely knows his own daughter</p>
        <p>But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water</p>
        <p>These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product</p>
        <p>They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada</p>
        <p>So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on</p>
        <p>Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da</p>
        <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
        <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
        <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
        <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
        <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
        <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
        <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
        <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
        <p>You better</p>
        <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
        <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
        <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
    <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
    <p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
    <p>You own it, you better never let it go</p>
    <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
    <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
    <p>You better</p>
    <p>You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p>
