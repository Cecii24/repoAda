        <h2>Letra</h2>
        <p>You and me, we used to be together</p>
        <p>Every day together, always</p>
        <p>I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend</p>
        <p>I can't believe this could be the end</p>
        <p> It looks as though you're lettin' go</p>
        <p> And if it's real, well, I don't want to know</p>
        <p> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'</p>
        <p> So please stop explainin'</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'</p>
        <p> I don't need your reasons</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> Our memories, well, they can be inviting</p>
        <p> But some are altogether mighty frightening</p>
        <p> As we die, both you and I</p>
        <p> With my head in my hands, I sit and cry</p>
        <p> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'</p>
        <p> So please stop explainin'</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts, no, no, no</p>
        <p> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'</p>
        <p> And I don't need your reasons</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> It's all ending</p>
        <p> We gotta stop pretending</p>
        <p> Who we are</p>
        <p> You and me</p>
        <p> I can see us dyin'</p>
        <p> Aren't we?</p>
        <p> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'</p>
        <p> So please stop explainin'</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'</p>
        <p> And I don't need your reasons</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts</p>
        <p> I know what you're sayin'</p>
        <p> So please stop explainin'</p>
        <p> Don't speak, don't speak</p>
        <p> Don't speak, no</p>
        <p> I know what you're thinkin'</p>
        <p> And I don't need your reasons</p>
        <p> I know you're good, I know you're good</p>
        <p> I know you're real good, oh</p>
